5. As a visitor, I want to be able to find the contact page easily to get the information I need and contact the garage.

### The Scope
To achieve my goal, I included the following features my website:

* Header containing the garages logo and the menu bar including Home, Gallery, and Contact.
* Home page which gives information about the garage for brand awareness.
* We are here for you ethos detailing the garage's believes and opening times.
* List of services provided right on the home page.
* Free call-in service availability on the home page with a button to take the user to the Contact Us page.
* Free call-in service availability on the home page with a button to take the user to the Contact Us page.
* Top Tip video from youtube giving some care tips for a brand new paint job.
* Contact Us Page with a contact form, contact details.
* Where to find us with a google map pinning its location.
* Footer containing the links to the garage's social media accounts.

### The Skeleton
The website consists of 3 pages. Home, Gallery, and Contact Us.
The Home page introduces the visitor to the business and gives it the main information needed. The Gallery shows the visitor past projects and helps the visitor identify if this business is right for them. Contact Us page allows the visitors to fill out a contact form if they do not wish to use the contact details provided. Please note that the finished website has some layout changes. Wireframes were used to give me just a basic idea.

## Features

### Header
The header consists of three pages; Home, Work and Contact. The header contains a logo and menu option on the top left of every page. This will create consistency throughout the page and the user can access the information through the menu bar and move around the site. The links remain active when in active page. The logo is fully responsive and re-directs to the main home page. 
### Footer
On every page, the footer contains social media icons which when clicked open in a new tab on the social media website. 

### Home Page
The Home page contains a We are here for you section that contains the business's ethos. To give reassurance to the visitor that their vehicle in good hands, followed by opening times.
Another section of that page is the Services Section. Its background is of a garage space filled with cars and centered in the image is of a BMW.  On top of this image, we have a list of services they provide.
Then there is a Free Call-in Service advertisement with a call for action button which brings the visitor to the Contact Us page to initiate contact.

### Gallery Page
The Gallery page features images in 4 columns wide for laptop and desktop, 2 for tablets, and 1 column wide for mobile devices. Each image can be clicked to open a fancybox window to view further images of each project.  At the bottom of the page, there is a Youtube video giving tips on how to take care of a new paint job to give a fun factor to the page and the visitors.

### Contact Us Page
Here we are greeted with a Get in touch form. Its purpose is to allow the customer to receive a call back from the business if they are unable to reach the business using the contact details provided.
We are featuring the contact details centered right under the contact form so that it hits the visitor straight in the eye and avoids them looking for it on the page. Under this is the Where to find us section containing the garage's address and a google map pinpointing its location.

### Future features
* Option to choose the language of the website from English to Portuguese. As the business owner is a Native Brazilian speaker, this would allow catering to the Portuguese-speaking community located around Co. Galway who maybe do not have any English to initiate contact.
* Showcase other projects that the business is doing like tractors, vans, and busses. This content was not available at the moment.
* Careers Page where vacancies could get advertised and maybe an opportunity to enroll in a partnership program.
